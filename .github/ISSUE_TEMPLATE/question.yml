      Thank you for asking a question! Use the sections below to submit a question **only** if it's related to samples in this repo. 
      
      - Questions that do not follow the below template will automatically be closed
      - Don't use questions to diagnose issues with samples, that's what bug reports are for!
      - All questions are welcome - let us know what's on your mind!
      - This repo is maintained by volunteers. Please be courteous and patient. üôÇ
      - Remember to include sufficient details and context.
      - If you have multiple questions please submit them separately so we can track resolution.
      - Screenshots are always helpful (just paste any images right here in the question)
      - If you're trying to start a conversation on a topic, consider using Discussions. We want to close every issue as quickly as possible, but discussions are intended for longer conversations.

        Who wrote the sample?
        
        Because of the way this repository is configured, samples authors do not get a notification when you create an issue. 
        
        For the section above **@mention any author of the sample**. Authors' GitHub handle can be found on the main sample documentation page, under the "Solution" section. 
        
        Questions without an @mention will automatically be closed, because authors won't get notified.
        
        **NOTE:** Don't @mention the repo maintainers, they already get notified.
